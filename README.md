# PDP8-ES simulator

Simulation of a pdp8 minicomputer running OS/8.
The simulator is designed to run on a ESP32 with OLED and 16MB or 4MB flash.  The OLED is used to mimic a PDP8/I console (67 lights).  The simulator will run without the console.
The images of an 3 RK05 disks and 2 dectapes are stored into flash partitions of the ESP32.  An SD card is supported to store more images and allow files for the simulated PTR: and PTP: devices.

This is a PlatformIO project running under the ESP32 Arduino platform.
